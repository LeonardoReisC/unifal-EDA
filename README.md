# unifal-EDA

This repository hosts the project file for the development of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) final project developed as part of the coursework at Federal University of Alfenas!

## Project Description

The final project of the Exploratory Data Analysis discipline focuses on validating the learning of EDA techniques through the analysis of a dataset. The project follows the steps outlined below:
   
- **Exploration of Variable Relationships**: use graphical tools to explore relationships between variables in the dataset.

- **Selection of a Supervised Learning Model**: choose a supervised learning model to solve the problem posed by the chosen dataset.

- **Data Transformation**: perform transformations on the dataset as necessary.

- **Evaluation of Transformation Impact**: assess the impact of the transformations performed in the previous step on the performance of the supervised learning model.
